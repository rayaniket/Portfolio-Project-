Project Heading: Covid-19 Data Analysis and Visualization using SQL

Summary :

1. Covid-19 Impact Analysis:
   - Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 data, exploring cases, deaths, and vaccinations globally and by location and continent.
   - Utilized SQL skills, including joins, CTEs, temp tables, aggregate functions, and window functions to process and analyze the data effectively.

2. Infection and Mortality Rates:
   - Calculated and compared the likelihood of dying if contracting Covid-19 in different countries.
   - Explored the percentage of the population infected with Covid-19 in various countries, highlighting regions with the highest infection rates.

3. Vaccination Progress:
   - Investigated the percentage of the population that received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose.
   - Utilized rolling calculations to track the number of vaccinated people over time in each location, providing insights into vaccination trends.

4. Data Visualization:
   - Created a view to store essential data for later visualizations and data presentations.
   - Prepared meaningful visualizations using the processed data, contributing to clear communication of insights to stakeholders.

Overall, this project showcased strong data analysis skills, SQL proficiency, 
and data visualization expertise in understanding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on different regions and populations.
